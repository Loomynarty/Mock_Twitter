# Mock_Twitter
This is the raw html / php code for my Mock Twitter Project a couple years ago. This used USBWebserver to host locally, which is included.
Code will most likely break without this USBWebserver.
To start, boot up the USBWebserver, and make sure Apache and MySQL are online.
Then go to localhost and open up landing.php
